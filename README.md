# Vala Code
## Vala Language Support for Visual Studio Code 

## Contributing

There are a few things I need help:

- More code snippets.

- Language Server:

    Preferably using `libvala` as most is already there. This is necessary for autocomplete and better formating.

If you wanna discuss any of them, feel free to send me a email or open a issue.
